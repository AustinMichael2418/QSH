set <qubits> - set with specified number of qubits
listgates    - list all defined gates
prob         - list probabilities of states
exit         - exit QSH
Any working quil Quil commands will work as well.

QSH has full Quil support other than the following features:
 - declaration commands
 - gate/circuit modifiers
 - dereferencing
 - pragmas
 - control modifiers
 - parametric gates/circuits

With these limitations in mind, you can find the Quil specs here:

I hope you enjoy using QSH to learn/practice quantum computing!
